# Buidling a Neural Network in Python using Numpy

- state: multilayer perceptron
- what I've added so far:
- layer class, neural network class, optimizer class and the derived class Momentum and convenience functions that
convert digits to one-hot-vectors

I loaded the MNIST dataset and train a 784-16-16-10 network to recognize digits.
